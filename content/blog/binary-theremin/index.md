### Binary Theremin is a multimedia instrument users can play by moving their body.

It was my final project for Kenyon's ARTS 360: Installation Art class. As a musician with no instrumental ability, I set out to create a physical means of composition that wasnâ€™t tied to a physical object. My hope is that through interacting with the piece, musicians and non-musicians alike were able to find inspiration in the unique audiovisual experience they created for themselves.
