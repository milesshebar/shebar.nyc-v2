Binary Theremin, 2018
Xbox Kinect v2, Max/MSP, Ableton Live, Speakers, Projection

Binary Theremin is a multimedia instrument users can play by moving their body. As a musician with no instrumental ability, I set out to create a physical means of composition that wasnâ€™t tied to a physical object. My hope is that through interacting with the piece, musicians and non-musicians alike will find inspiration in the unique audiovisual experience they create for themselves.
