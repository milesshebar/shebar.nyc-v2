Consortium, 2018
Metal, WebRTC

While the Internet has potential as a tool for effective mass communication, its corporate overlords have created echo chambers that reinforce our own biases by way of targeted ads and algorithms. I wanted to use the power of the internet locally, using high-res live video streams to connect two disparate communities that might not interact with each other on a regular basis. Consortium is a mixed-media installation consisting of two 'windows' that stream video to each other, enabling viewers to see people at the other location in real time. Each 'window' consists of a metal stand, a monitor in portrait orientation, a webcam, and a computer that streams video over the local network via a custom-built web app. In its current iteration, it streams video between Thomas Hall (New Side) and Peirce Hall (Old Side), communities that can often feel far removed despite their physical proximity. How to interact with the piece, or whether to interact with it at all, is up to the viewer, but my hope is that the installation will create opportunities for connection in ways that are not data-driven but genuine in their randomness.
