### We are in the golden age of surveillance, and data collection is rampant.

For the first half of my senior exercise in Studio Art, I began thinking about data, specifically personal data.

Google has a tool called <a href="https://takeout.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Takeout</a>, which lets you download copies of your account's data. It's stunning how many different things they collect. One of the datasets that surprised me most: my location history. My phone takes a GPS reading about once per minute, and sends it off to Google's servers.

Though I felt uneasy knowing this data was out there somewhere, I was strangely compelled to examine it. Using some simple Python scripts, I generated high-resolution SVG scatterplots of the data.

I lasercut the scatterplots onto sheets of acrylic and spraypainted them.

Despite the Orwellian baggage that comes with this stuff, looking at the maps was an emotionally nostalgic experience for me, like looking at a map of memories.
